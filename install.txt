Moodle Lightbox Gallery v2.2.1 (12th May 09)

 * INSTALLATION *

To install this plugin, upload the lightboxgallery folder and it's contents into your /mod folder in
your Moodle install. After uploading, login as admin and visit your Admin/Notifications page (you'll
find this page at http://yoursite.com/moodle/admin/index.php), which will setup the required database
tables and complete the installation.

After installation you'll find an extra item on your resources menu when editing a page. In an English
install of Moodle it will be named 'Add a lightbox gallery', this could differ for other languages.

 * UPGRADING *

If you are upgrading this plugin from a previous version, you should copy the contents of this archive
over your previous version. You MUST then visit your Admin/Notification page - at which point Moodle
will complete the upgrade to the current version.

Please note that after upgrading to version 2.1 the folder 'edittype' in the root of the lightbox
gallery install folder can be safely removed (it's been renamed to 'edit').

After upgrading to version 2.2 you can safely remove the 'css', 'images' and 'js' folders (the content
of these folders has been moved into the new 'scripts' folder).

This plugin was designed for Moodle version 1.9 and upwards
